# zkverify-poc

End-to-end proof of concept: TLS-attested employer data verified on-chain via zkTLS + ZK proofs on Zeko testnet.

## What it does

1. A TLSNotary prover connects to a mock employer HTTPS server and produces a cryptographic attestation of the TLS session.
2. Attested fields (employer name, salary, employment status) are extracted from the attestation.
3. An o1js ZK circuit proves eligibility predicates over those fields without revealing raw values.
4. The proof hash and result are settled on-chain to a `VerificationRegistry` zkApp on Zeko testnet.
5. On-chain state is verified via GraphQL queries against the Zeko node.

## Security model and boundaries

Implemented hardening in this repository:
- Settlement now requires a typed ZK proof object in `VerificationRegistry.recordVerification`; the contract verifies it in-circuit before mutating state.
- The eligibility circuit pins a trusted notary secp256k1 public key and does not accept prover-chosen key/policy witness values.
- Eligibility policy values are fixed for the PoC circuit (`salary >= 50_000`, `tenure >= 12 months`, `status == active`, evaluation date `2026-02-18`).
- TLS prover request inputs are sanitized to reject CRLF/header-injection payloads.
- Pipeline startup waits for active service readiness (mock server + notary) instead of fixed sleeps.

Known PoC limitation that remains out-of-scope in this cycle:
- The circuit does not yet include transcript byte-range inclusion proofs that bind disclosed business fields directly to authenticated transcript commitments. This is a documented next-step hardening item for post-PoC work.

## Prerequisites

- [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) (toolchain manager -- installs Node, pnpm, moon)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) stable toolchain
- OpenSSL development headers (`brew install openssl` / `apt install libssl-dev`)

## Quick start (existing deployment)

If `.env` is already configured and the contract is deployed:

```bash
moon run workspace:run
```

Run the ineligible-user negative flow (expected prove-stage rejection):

```bash
moon run workspace:run-ineligible
```

## Setup from scratch

1. **Install toolchain:**
   ```bash
   proto install node latest --pin local -y
   proto install pnpm latest --pin local -y
   ```

2. **Initialize submodules:**
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Generate wallet and `.env`:**
   ```bash
   moon run poc:gen-wallet
   ```

4. **Fund the fee payer** from the [Zeko faucet](https://zeko.io/faucet) using the `FEE_PAYER_PUBLIC_KEY` printed by the previous step.

5. **Deploy the contract** (one-time):
   ```bash
   moon run poc:deploy
   ```
   This deploys the contract using the `ZKAPP_PRIVATE_KEY` generated in step 3. The deployed address is written to `output/deployed-address.json`.

6. **Run the pipeline:**
   ```bash
   moon run workspace:run
   ```

## Environment variables

All values live in `.env` (generated by `poc:gen-wallet`, git-ignored).

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ZEKO_GRAPHQL_URL` | yes | Zeko testnet GraphQL endpoint |
| `FEE_PAYER_PRIVATE_KEY` | yes | Fee payer private key (Base58) |
| `FEE_PAYER_PUBLIC_KEY` | yes | Fee payer public key (Base58) |
| `ZKAPP_PUBLIC_KEY` | pipeline | zkApp address -- required by `settle` and `verify-chain` |
| `ZKAPP_PRIVATE_KEY` | deploy | zkApp private key -- required by `deploy`; if omitted, an ephemeral key is generated |
| `TLSNOTARY_SIGNING_KEY_HEX` | yes | TLSNotary signing key (hex) |

Optional runner controls:
- `RUN_POC_SERVICE_READY_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default `30`)
- `RUN_POC_SERVICE_READY_POLL_INTERVAL_SEC` (default `1`)
- `RUN_POC_SKIP_READY_CHECK=1` (testing only)

## Pipeline stages

Each `workspace:run` invocation creates a timestamped output directory (e.g. `output/2026-02-19T14-30-00/`).

| # | Stage | Artifact |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | Start mock employer HTTPS server | -- |
| 2 | TLSNotary attestation | `attestation.json` |
| 3 | Extract attested fields | `disclosed-fields.json` |
| 4 | Generate ZK proof (o1js) | `proof.json`, `verification-key.json` |
| 5 | Verify proof locally | -- |
| 6 | Settle proof on-chain | -- |
| 7 | Verify on-chain state via GraphQL | -- |

Negative-flow runner:
- `moon run workspace:run-ineligible` runs the same orchestration with `TLSN_ENDPOINT=/api/v1/employee/EMP-002` and expects proof generation to fail at `poc:prove` due eligibility policy mismatch.

## Running individual stages

```bash
moon run mock-server:serve    # start mock HTTPS server
moon run tlsnotary:notary     # start notary server
moon run tlsnotary:prover     # run TLS prover
moon run poc:extract          # extract attested fields
moon run poc:prove            # generate ZK proof
moon run poc:verify           # verify proof locally
moon run poc:deploy           # deploy contract (one-time)
moon run poc:settle           # settle proof on-chain
moon run poc:verify-chain     # verify on-chain state
```

## Output artifacts

Per-run (in `output/<timestamp>/`):
- `attestation.json` -- TLSNotary attestation
- `disclosed-fields.json` -- extracted employer fields
- `proof.json` -- ZK proof
- `verification-key.json` -- circuit verification key

Standalone stage default (when `OUTPUT_DIR` is unset):
- `output/latest/attestation.json`
- `output/latest/disclosed-fields.json`
- `output/latest/proof.json`
- `output/latest/verification-key.json`

Fixed:
- `output/deployed-address.json` -- deployed zkApp metadata

## UI (Nuxt SPA)

The `ui/` project is a strict client-side Nuxt SPA (`ssr: false`) for browsing proof runs.

Data ingestion contract:
- A custom Nuxt module copies timestamped run folders from `output/<timestamp>/` into `ui/public/proof-data/runs/<timestamp>/`.
- The module also copies `output/deployed-address.json` into `ui/public/proof-data/deployed-address.json` when present.
- `ui/public/proof-data/manifest.json` is generated at Nuxt startup/build.
- No server rendering is used; refresh copied data by restarting `moon run ui:dev`.

Run locally:

```bash
moon run ui:dev
```

Build static assets:

```bash
moon run ui:generate
```

UI routes:
- `/` directory of timestamped proof runs
- `/proof/:runId` certificate overview
- `/proof/:runId/detail` full cryptographic record

Cloudflare Worker static deploy config is at `ui/wrangler.jsonc` (SPA fallback enabled).
Deploy command:

```bash
moon run ui:deploy
```

## On-chain verification

```bash
moon run poc:verify-chain
```

Queries the Zeko GraphQL node for the zkApp account state and events. Verifies that the on-chain `proofHash` and `result` match the local proof, and that a matching settlement event exists.

## Development

```bash
moon run workspace:validate   # typecheck + lint + format + tests
```

**Test locations:**
- `poc/tests/*.spec.ts`
- `mock-server/tests/*.spec.ts`
- Rust unit tests in `tlsnotary/src/*`

**Moon project layout:**
- `workspace` -- repo orchestration (install, validate, run)
- `poc` -- TypeScript proving/settlement
- `mock-server` -- HTTPS fixture server
- `tlsnotary` -- Rust notary and prover
- `ui` -- Nuxt SPA proof explorer + Cloudflare worker static deployment

## Security

- Private keys are local-only and git-ignored.
- Never commit `.env` or private key files.
